The part 2 proposal of our final project is to continue implementing the parts 
mentioned in the initial specification.  These are:

-Implementing the Credence reputation system
-Using cryptography to encode and decode messages sent
-Developing & Implementing a barrier to entry.

If we have time, we may implement some of the following:

- Adding a feature such that if the user picks a directory to share, our Peerster
recursively shares all files in that directory.

- Adding support for files larger than 3 MB by recursively applying this procedure.

- Adding support for more types of searches: recognizing special words "and" and
  "or", to allow users to specify searches like "foo and bar", or "foo or bar".

- Implement a system where a user can view files that are above a certain Credence rating.
