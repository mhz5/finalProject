The third part of our final project will involve adding to Peerster by implementing
challenge exercises from lab 3. We plan to implement some of the following:

- Adding a feature such that if the user picks a directory to share, our Peerster
recursively shares all files in that directory.

- Adding support for files larger than 3 MB by recursively applying this procedure.

- Adding support for more types of searches: recognizing special words "and" and
  "or", to allow users to specify searches like "foo and bar", or "foo or bar".

Finally, building off of the Credence reputation system we plan to implement a
system where a user can view files that are above a certain Credence rating.
