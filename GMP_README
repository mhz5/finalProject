# In the Makefile, around line 103, the make statement is as follows:

$(TARGET):  $(OBJECTS)  
	$(LINK) $(LFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS) $(OBJCOMP) $(LIBS)

# Append this snippet: " -L/gmp -lgmp" to end up with

$(TARGET):  $(OBJECTS)  
	$(LINK) $(LFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS) $(OBJCOMP) $(LIBS)  -L/gmp -lgmp

# Create finalProject/gmp directory

# In your ~/.bash_profile, add finalProject/gmp to your $PATH:

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cs426/peerster/finalProject/gmp

# Inside gmp-6.0.0 directory (the actual gmp package), run:

ls -l mpn/m4-ccas
chmod +x mpn/m4-ccas
./configure prefix=$HOME/cs426/peerster/finalProject/gmp

# The prefix flag configures the Makefile in the proper directory. Otherwise, gmp would attempt to install in /usr/local, which we don't have permissions for.

# Now from finalProject/gmp:

make
make check !!! Make sure to make check, to ensure that gmp compiled successfully !!!

# File "crypto.cc" should have the line
	
	> #include "gmp/gmp.h"

# at the top. This should import the gmp module. If you did not install gmp in finalProject/gmp, then #include the proper installation directory.
